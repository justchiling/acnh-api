    description: "This masterpiece, painted by 17th century Dutch artist Rembrandt, depicts a military gathering. At the time, portraits usually showed their subjects standing still. So this was a leap forward in technique. For many years, art scholars thought the painting was set at night, but a restoration revealed a dark varnish. We can now see the dynamic poses and lighting as they were meant to be seenâ€”in the daytime!"
